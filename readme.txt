== Instructions for candidates ==
To get setup:
1. Activate the plugin
2. Create a new page
3. Add the shortcode [test-shortcode] to the page
4. Access the page


The purpose of the plugin is to allow the current logged in user to select and save their favourite colour. The plugin has some errors in the JS, CSS and php that need correcting.

We do not expect you to fix all issues in the time given.

Here are some issues to get started:

- The colour is not being saved to the user options (via an Ajax call)
- When loading the page, if a colour has been previously saved that should be shown as the 'active' colour
- When selecting colours, previously selected colours should lose their highlighted border
- The colour boxes should appear in a single row
- Feedback is not being shown after the Ajax call
- No film information is saved / sent

Finally, please think about what could be done to improve the structure of this plugin (file structure / coding standards / security etc)
